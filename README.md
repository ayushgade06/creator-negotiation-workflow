markdown# Creator Negotiation Workflow

Backend service that automates creator-brand negotiation for affiliate marketing campaigns. Receives a creator message, classifies intent and conversation stage, applies business rules, and returns a structured decision with a draft response.

## Architecture

Express REST API backed by MongoDB. The core workflow is a linear pipeline of LLM agents followed by a deterministic business rules engine. State is persisted across turns via a `Conversation` document.
HTTP → Controller → WorkflowService → Agents → BusinessRules → ResponseAgent → MongoDB

Two MongoDB collections:
- `Conversation` — mutable, tracks current negotiation state across turns
- `WorkflowRun` — immutable audit log, one record per workflow execution

## Workflow

1. **Load or create Conversation** — if `conversationId` is provided, append the new message to the existing conversation; otherwise create a new one.
2. **Build context** — trim history to last 10 messages; attach rolling conversation summary.
3. **Run analysis agents in sequence** — Intent, Stage, Risk, Enthusiasm.
4. **Apply business rules** — pure function consuming agent outputs; returns `action` and `requiresHumanApproval`.
5. **Generate draft reply** — LLM-generated for most actions; hardcoded for `HUMAN_REVIEW` & `SHIPPING_QUERY`.
6. **Generate conversation summary** — 2-sentence summary for next-turn context.
7. **Persist state** — update `Conversation`, create `WorkflowRun`.
8. **Return structured output.**

## LLM Usage

| Agent | Why LLM |
|---|---|
| Intent | Classifies free-text creator messages into business-meaningful categories |
| Stage | Classifies overall conversation trajectory |
| Risk | Detects fraud signals, abusive tone, and unrealistic demands |
| Enthusiasm | Scores creator engagement — requires sentiment understanding |
| Response | Generates contextual, professional draft replies |
| Summarizer | Produces rolling 2-sentence business summaries for future context |

All agents run at `temperature: 0` for determinism. All agents return structured JSON via Ollama's `format: "json"` mode.

## Deterministic Business Logic

All decisions happen in `src/rules/businessRules.js` — a pure function with no LLM calls:

- `confidence < 0.7` → `HUMAN_REVIEW`
- `riskLevel === "HIGH"` → `HUMAN_REVIEW`
- `negotiationRounds >= 4` → `HUMAN_REVIEW` (negotiation fatigue)
- `intent === "REQUEST_INFORMATION"` → `PROVIDE_INFORMATION`
- `requestedFee > maxBudget * 2` → `HUMAN_REVIEW`
- `intent === "DECLINE_COLLABORATION"` → `CLOSE_CONVERSATION`
- `requestedFee > maxBudget` → `COUNTER_OFFER`
- Default → `APPROVE`

## State Management

Conversation state is stored in MongoDB. Key fields on `Conversation`:

- `messages[]` — full message history (CREATOR / BRAND roles)
- `currentStage` — latest classified stage
- `negotiationRounds` — counter incremented each NEGOTIATING turn
- `enthusiasmScore` — latest creator enthusiasm score
- `riskLevel` — latest risk classification
- `conversationSummary` — rolling LLM-generated summary
- `requiresHumanApproval` — flag for human intervention
- `workflowStatus` — `ACTIVE | WAITING_HUMAN | COMPLETED`

Conversation history is trimmed to the last 10 messages before being passed to agents to control context size.

## API

### POST /api/workflows/process

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "creator": { "name": "Sarah", "platform": "TikTok", "followers": 25000 },
  "campaign": {
    "product": "Uno Card Game",
    "commission": "30%",
    "fixedFeeRange": "$0-$100",
    "brief": "Creator should make a short TikTok showing friends playing the card game."
  },
  "latestMessage": "I'd be interested, but I usually charge $300.",
  "conversationId": "<optional — omit for new conversation>"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "conversationId": "...",
    "currentStage": "NEGOTIATING",
    "intent": "NEGOTIATE_COMPENSATION",
    "recommendedAction": "HUMAN_REVIEW",
    "requiresHumanApproval": true,
    "workflowStatus": "WAITING_HUMAN",
    "confidence": 0.98,
    "enthusiasmScore": 82,
    "riskLevel": "LOW",
    "negotiationFatigue": false,
    "conversationSummary": "...",
    "draftReply": "...",
    "reasoningSummary": "Requested fee exceeds twice the campaign budget."
  }
}
```

## Test Scenarios

Individual agent tests: `node test-intent.js`, `test-stage.js`, `test-risk.js`, etc.

Full workflow: `node test-workflow.js` (requires MongoDB and Ollama running locally).

**Scenario 1 — Interested creator:**  
Message: `"This sounds like a great opportunity, I'd love to participate!"`  
Expected: `stage: INTERESTED`, `action: APPROVE`, `requiresHumanApproval: false`

**Scenario 2 — Creator negotiating compensation:**  
Message: `"I'd be interested, but I usually charge $300 for a TikTok video."`  
Expected: `stage: NEGOTIATING`, `action: HUMAN_REVIEW`, `requiresHumanApproval: true` (fee = 3× budget)

**Scenario 3 — Creator requesting more information:**  
Message: `"Can you tell me more about the content requirements and timeline?"`  
Expected: `stage: NEEDS_MORE_INFORMATION`, `action: PROVIDE_INFORMATION`, `requiresHumanApproval: false`

**Scenario 4 — Creator declining:**  
Message: `"Thanks for reaching out, but this isn't a fit for me right now."`  
Expected: `stage: NOT_INTERESTED`, `action: CLOSE_CONVERSATION`, `requiresHumanApproval: false`

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # fill in MONGODB_URI and LLM_MODEL
npm install
npm run dev
```

Requires: Node 18+, MongoDB, Ollama with `qwen2.5:3b` (or set `LLM_MODEL` env var).

## Scaling Considerations

**1,000 creators:** Current architecture handles this without changes. Add indexes on `workflowStatus` and `creator.name`.

**10,000 creators:** Move agent execution to a job queue (BullMQ + Redis). HTTP endpoint enqueues the job and returns a job ID; client polls or receives a webhook. Run Ollama on a dedicated GPU instance. Parallelise the four analysis agents with `Promise.all()`.

**100,000 creators:** Shard MongoDB or migrate to PostgreSQL. Replace Ollama with a hosted LLM API (Anthropic, OpenAI) for reliability and throughput. Introduce a proper orchestration layer (Temporal) for durable workflow execution with retry, timeout, and human task queues. Add a caching layer (Redis) for campaign data.
